# Blackjack Refactoring Challenge #

**_IN PROGRESS.  The code is already terrible, but it's not complete._**

You've been hired by an online casino to maintain their blackjack program.
Apparently, the previous developers all quit.  Good luck.

Your first day, you are given commit access and the following priority-sorted
list of feature requests:

- Support multiple players on the same server (but limit the number of players
  at a table)
- Support multiple tables on the same server
- Allow player to split
- Support for up to 8 decks (specific value configurable per table)
- Allow player to buy insurance
- Allow player to surrender (configurable per server)
- Dealer hits on soft 17 (configurable per table)

You are also told to fix any bugs if they represent a substantial risk to your
employer's profits.  Anything that enables cheating or irritates the gaming
commision falls into this category.  Such bugs take top priority.  Any other
bugs are lowest priority, so you can work on them if you manage to fix all
high-priority bugs _and_ implement all the feature requests.
