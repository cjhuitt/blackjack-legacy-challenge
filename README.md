# Blackjack Refactoring Challenge #

You've been hired by an online casino to maintain their blackjack program.
Apparently, the previous developers all quit.  Good luck.

Your first day, you are given the following priority-sorted list of feature
requests:

- Support multiple players on the same server (but limit the number of players
  at a table)
- Support multiple tables on the same server
- Allow player to split
- Allow player to buy insurance
- Support for up to 8 decks (specific value configurable per table)
- Dealer hits on soft 17 (configurable per table)
- Allow player to surrender (configurable per server)
